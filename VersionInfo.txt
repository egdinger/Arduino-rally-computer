Version info for Arduino rally computer
011a: First numbered version
011b: Fixed current speed bug.
011c: Fixed Power on 50 displayed after totoal odo reading bug
011d: Added error codes in the default cases, added a raw odo value output page for testings.
      Refactored names in the menu and button state machines to make it more readable.
021d: Should have updated the feature space when adding the raw value menu page. Also reordered the menu pages so
      debug and raw come last.
121d: Hardware updated with i2c/spi lcd backpack. Code has some changes to reflect this. Now the LED display strobes when updated.
      This is unacceptable, am looking into how to fix. Code is very hacky right now.
131d: Press 5 to switch the led display into clock display mode.
